# GIMP Plugin Installer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tschuy/gpi.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tschuy/gpi)

Install GIMP plugins from the command line with a simple, easy to use package
manager.

Usage
-----

Install from gpi-web:

```
$ gpi install imguruploader
```

Uninstall an installed package:
```
$ gpi uninstall imguruploader
```

Install from a locally downloaded file:
```
$ gpi install -f ~/imgur-uploader.tar.gz
```

Anatomy of a gpi package (aka how to package your plugin)
---------------------------------------------------------

The root level of a gpi package requires two things: a ``gpi.json`` manifest
file, and a ``contents/`` directory. The ``contents/`` directory will be
extracted directly to the user's GIMP plugin directory, so make sure you only
include files necessary for your plugin. You can put other content, like a
LICENSE or CHANGELOG, in the root of the package. Files outside of ``contents/``
will be ignored.

Your ``gpi.json`` file should look like this:

```
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "name": "Imgur Uploader",
    "identifier": "imguruploader",
    "author": "tschuy",
    "license": "MIT",
    "type": "python",
    "url": "https://github.com/tschuy/gimp-export-to-imgur",
    "description": "Upload your images to Imgur directly from the Save menu"
}
```

The type of a plugin can either by ``python`` or ``scriptfu``. If it is missing,
``gpi`` will assume the plugin is Python and extract it to the ``plug-ins``
directory.

To test your plugin, pass your ``.tar.gz`` to gpi with the ``-f`` flag. Open
GIMP, and verify your plugin works as expected.

Testing gpi
-----------

Currently, ``gpi`` has very limited tests. Pull requests with additional tests
are happily accepted!

``gpi`` uses Python's built-in ``unittest`` library. To run the tests, run
``python setup.py test`` within the root of the repository.

A pre-commit hook has been provided for your convenience. This hook runs the
test suite (which takes approximately two seconds) and the PEP8 flaker. (For
the flaker to work, install ``flake8`` with pip.) To use this hook, copy
``tests/pre-commit`` into ``.git/hooks/``.

Architecture
------------

``gpi``'s backend is laid out into two different install modules, with a
separate executable for the command line program and, soon, a fourth file for
mangaging plugins directly from GIMP itself.

Anything web-related goes in ``gpi.web``. These functions interface with the
web portion of GPI, so the ``get_from_web`` function that returns a ``tarfile``
object for a given package name lives in here, as does the function to get
package info from the API.

``gpi.web`` is currently in need of tests.

In ``gpi.installer`` lives the generic installer/uninstaller functions. Here you
can install a plugin with ``gpi.installler.install``, uninstall with
``gpi.installler.uninstall``. This module also holds some generic information
like the ``info`` commands for getting local/remote package info, as well as
the plugin list. These should be moved to more appropriate modules in the
future.

``gpi.installer`` is currently well-tested.

Lastly, the command line executable lives in ``bin/gpi``. This executable is
home to the args parsing, and decides which code paths to take.

``bin/gpi`` needs tests, and should be re-written.
